## What this does
Helps discover and plan item combinations in the popular League of Legends game Teamfight Tactics. May turn into website tool later.

After cloning repository, run script using `python script.py`.

Enter your held basic items, which hold the following keywords:
```
bf
rod
bow
tear
vest
cloak
belt
spat
```

To remove an item, type `[item name] --`.

The script will give you a list of current combinable items, as well as a list of the next 10 best potential items, mostly as determined by TidesOfTimes's [item tier list](https://i.imgur.com/7B2ORNV.png).
